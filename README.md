CSS Flexbox Layout Module

Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

    Block, for sections in a webpage
    Inline, for text
    Table, for two-dimensional table data
    Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.(w3school)
